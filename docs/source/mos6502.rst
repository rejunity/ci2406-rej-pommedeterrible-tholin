MOS6502
=======

This design is a cycle-accurate implementation of the MOS6502 CPU, though it does not implement all of the originalâ€™s control signals. Most of the therefore unused pins instead expose various internal CPU flags for debugging, but can be ignored during normal usage.

Custom Settings
---------------

This design uses the least significant two bits of the Custom Settings register to modify the behavior of the WEb pin. By default (mprj_settings = 0), the WEb signal behaves as originally, always strobing low for a full clock period.

It may, however, also be set as follows:

``1``: WEb strobes only during the low period of the clock

``2``: WEb strobes only during the high period of the clock
